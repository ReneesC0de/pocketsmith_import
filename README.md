# pocketsmith_import
A multi-phase project beginning with a budget database in Postgres SQL

Phase 1:
Postgres SQL Database with tables for budget categories, budget amounts, pay periods, and transaction imports.

Phase 2:
Python with Pocketsmith API to import PocketSmith transactions and budget information.

Phase 3:
Integrate with a PowerBI dashboard for analytics and exportation.

Phase 4:
Design a program to simplify future-casting, budget updates, and tracking that allows for an "Every other week" pay period view. This final phase would integrate all tools and create a mult-faceted approach to budget management for those who like to dig around in their data, as well as project out potential budget impacts for purchase, payoffs, etc.
